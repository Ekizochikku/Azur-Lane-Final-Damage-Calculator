# Azur-Lane-Final-Damage-Calculator
A Java application meant to calculate how much one shot/torpedo/bomb/etc. will do.
Only the ship, weapon, and skills are calculating damage at the moment.<br><br>
<B>WARNING: We do not claim these to be exact damage calculations. These are close estimates (hopefully) of the damage you can expect a ship to do under these conditions.<br><br>
<B>Future inclusions: Carriers and planes, Auxiliary items.
