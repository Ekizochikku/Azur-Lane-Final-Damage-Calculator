# Azur-Lane-Final-Damage-Calculator
This is an application that will calculate the final damage done by a single shot or load of a weapon in the mobile game Azur Lane. Calculations are calculated through the stats given by the ship, weapons and equipment(later?), and skills.

# Important-Info
<B>*****I'm still alive. I'm still updating when I can.*****</B>

<B> Currently messing with overhauling somethings, so will try to get this updated to that.</B>

<B> We will implement new game changes when we can. </B>

<B> Current Updated Data (Ish): Vacation Lane (11/26/2020)(Collab ships not in yet) </B>

Calculations are done with preset conditions:
- Ships are level 120 and stats are represented of that. If the ship has a retrofir that changes the ship type, both the pre and post retro level 120 stats will be shown.
- Danger level is reduced to the max of the given world
- All skills are at level 10 stats
- Conditions for the skills are met
- There are some skills that won't have any effect unless it's paired with the correct ship.

<B>WARNING: Take these calculations with a grain of salt. These are very close estimates (hopefully. Some may be exact) of the damage you can expect a ship to do under these conditions.</B> In regards to skills, you will have almost complete freedom to apply whatever skill and the stats that come with those skills. Do note that this will greatly skew the predicted damage. <B>Do what you want, but if you want to get close-to-accurate data, do your skills-research and don't be silly ^.^.</B>


<B>In Progress Functionality/Items: Updating Names, Cleaning Up Stuff</B>

<B>PLEASE MESSAGE ISSUES (MISPELLING, MISSING GEAR, SHIPS, SKILLS, ETC.) AND SUGGESTIONS (MAY OR MAY NOT TAKE THEM) USING DISCORD TO: Ekizochikku#3751 or Scription#0640. We are humans and make mistakes too.</B>
