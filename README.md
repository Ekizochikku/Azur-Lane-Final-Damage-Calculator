# Azur-Lane-Final-Damage-Calculator
This is an application that will calculate the final damage done by a single shot or load of a weapon in the mobile game Azur Lane. Calculations are calculated through the stats given by the ship, weapons and equipment(later?), and skills.

# Important-Info
<B> We will implement new game changes when we can. </B>

<B> Current Updated Data: Swirling Cherry Blossoms </B>

Calculations are done with preset conditions:
- Ships are level 120 and stats are represented of that. If they have a retrofit that does not change their ship type, the ship will be represented as a level 120 retrofit
- Danger level is reduced to the max of the given world
- All skills are at level 10 stats
- Conditions for the skills are met
- There are some skills that won't have any effect unless it's paired with the correct ship. (List down below. May not keep this up to date sorry!)

<B>WARNING: Take these calculations with a grain of salt. These are very close estimates (hopefully. Some may be exact) of the damage you can expect a ship to do under these conditions.</B> In regards to skills, you will have almost complete freedom to apply whatever skill and the stats that come with those skills. Do note that this will greatly skew the predicted damage. <B>Do what you want, but if you want to get close-to-accurate data, do your skills-research and don't be silly ^.^.</B>
